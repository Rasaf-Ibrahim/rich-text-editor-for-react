        update_wysiwyg_state(draft => {
            draft.formats_of_selected_text.font = selectedValue

        /* ðŸ”– Just like handleFont, in the handleHeader, handleBold, etc functions, you will see that we are updating both the 
        
            1) quillRef.current.format & 
            2) wysiwyg_state.formats_of_selected_text state


          There is no confusion in updating the quillRef.current.format but why are updating the state as well? 

          Let me first remind you, 'wysiwyg_state.formats_of_selected_text' state holds the formats of the selected text. We are  updating this state in the 'selection-change' event of quill

          So, when we select a text and change its format the state gets updated automatically inside the 'selection-change' event. So,  there is no need to update the state manually here in this 'handleFont' function when we select a text 

          But what about when we haven't written anything, there will be nothing to select, right? 
          
          Suppose, we have gone to a new line and before writing anything we want to change the font and bold option for the new line first before typing. How would you do that? 
          
          In this situation, 'selection-change' event will not get triggered because we are not selecting any text. So, there is no way we can update the state 'wysiwyg_state.formats_of_selected_text' if we just depend of 'selection-change' event's state update.

          So, we need to update the state manually as well in the handleFont, handleHeader, handleItalic, etc functions so that we can even update the state even when we haven't selected any text.
