/* ðŸ”– As we have multiple output files and multiple type declaration files, the module field and types field in the package.json are insufficient.

To address this problem, we have implemented the suggestions outlined in the article (https://dev.to/binjospookie/exports-in-package-json-1fl2) by utilizing the "exports" field and the "typesVersions" field.

While the main purpose of the "typesVersions" field differs from our specific use case, it adequately resolves our issue, so we are content with it.
