### Common Errors & Solution
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>



<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### `ReactTextEditor` cannot be used as a JSX component

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- This error is not exclusive to this package. It can occur in Next.js projects utilizing TypeScript, especially during the build process. 
- A quick fix to bypass this error is to assign the `any` type to the "RichTextEditor" component as shown below:

  ```tsx showLineNumbers {1} /any/ copy  
   const RichTextEditor: any = dynamic(
      () => import('rich-text-editor-for-react'),
      {
          ssr: false,
          loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
      }
    )
  ```

- However, it's important to note that using the `any` type will disable the TypeScript type checking for the "RichTextEditor" component, meaning you won't receive proper typing assistance from your IDE.

- To maintain type safety during development, you might consider using the `any` type only before building for production, as this error generally doesn't occur in development mode.
