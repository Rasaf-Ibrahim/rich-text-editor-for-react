### Edit Generated HTML
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>

The `RichTextEditor` component is primarily designed for creating rich-text documents. However, it also supports editing previously generated content using the optional `initialValue` prop

<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Using the `initialValue` Prop for Editing

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

Let's understand this with an example. Assume that you've fetched previously generated HTML content from the database and stored it in a variable named `fetched_html`.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

Here's how you can utilize the `RichTextEditor` component for editing:

```ts showLineNumbers copy  
// import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook

export default function Demo() {

  // ...

  return (
    <RichTextEditor
        // set the initial content for editing
        initialValue={fetched_html} 

        // pass other required and optional props
    />
  )
}
```

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


**Code Explanation**:

- `initialValue`: An optional prop that accepts the HTML string that was previously generated by the "RichTextEditor" component. This sets the initial content for the editor, allowing users to pick up right where they saved last time.
