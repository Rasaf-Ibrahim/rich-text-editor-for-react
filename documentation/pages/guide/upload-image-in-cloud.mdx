### Upload Image in Cloud
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>


If you have read about [toolbarOptions](/render-rich-text-editor#toolbaroptions), you may already know you have two choices for handling images. The first is embedding images as base64 strings directly in the editor. The second is uploading images to cloud storage and using the image URL in the editor.

If you've passed for the `image_base64` in the `toolbarOptions` prop, you're all setâ€”no further configuration is needed. However, if you've passed `image_cloud` because you prefer to store images in the cloud and use URLs in the editor, then this guide is for you.

#### How the Image Upload to Cloud Happens: A Quick Overview

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- As you have choosen `image_cloud`, so now everytime user inserts an image on the editor, it will get inserted as a `blob` image.

- Now, let's assume there's a "Submit" button that the user clicks after they've finished writing. At this point, all blob images in the output will be uploaded to your cloud storage. After a successful upload, each blob URL will be replaced with its corresponding cloud URL.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

> *Why Have We Decided to Upload Images All at Once Instead of One by One?*
>
> - When users are writing, they often insert multiple images just to try them out. If we upload images one by one as they're added, we risk uploading images that the user might eventually remove. Even if we track these removed images and delete them from cloud storage, this approach still consumes extra time and bandwidth unnecessarily.
> - Moreover, If the user upload couple of images individually and closes the browser or uninstalls the browser, we lose the ability to track the images that has already been uploaded.
> - Conversely, by waiting for a "Submit" action and only uploading the images that the user has finalized, we can optimize both time and bandwidth usage.





<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Prerequisite

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

You'll need a backend server to manage cloud uploads. You can use any programming language or framework of your choice for the backend server.

Below, we'll walk through setting up both the frontend and backend.



<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Setting Up the Frontend

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

Initially, we'll go through the code, followed by an in-depth explanation

```tsx showLineNumbers /isImageOperationsEnabled/ /enableImageOperations/ /imageOperationsData/  /fetchImageOperationsData/ /cloudImageApiEndpoint/ copy
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
 
// import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook/
// ...
 
export default function Demo() {
 
    // Destructuring properties from useRichTextEditor
    const {
        output,
        fetchOutput, 
        isImageOperationsEnabled,  
        enableImageOperations,  
        imageOperationsData,  
        fetchImageOperationsData  
    } = useRichTextEditor()
 
    // handleSubmit function
    const handleSubmit = () => {
        enableImageOperations() 
    }
 
    //Using useRef for conditional useEffect execution
    const notInitialRender = useRef(false)
 
    // useEffect hook
    useEffect(() => {
 
        if (notInitialRender.current) {
            // Custom code placeholder
            // Put your code here. The code will only run when the dependency changes, not on the initial render of the component
        } 

        else {
            notInitialRender.current = true  
        }
 
    }, [imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink])  
 
    
    // JSX
    return (
 
        <div> 
 
            <RichTextEditor
            
                toolbarOptions={[
                    'image_cloud',
                    //...
                ]}
 
                customizeUI={{
                    // ...
                }}
 
                fetchOutput={fetchOutput}
 
                imageValidation={{
                    maximumFileSize: 1024,
                    acceptableFileFormats: ['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg']
                }}
 
                cloudImageApiEndpoint="https://your-server-domain.com/api/v1/rte/manage-image"  
 
                isImageOperationsEnabled={isImageOperationsEnabled}  
 
                fetchImageOperationsData={fetchImageOperationsData}  
            />
 
            {/* Submit button */}
            <button onClick={handleSubmit}>
                Submit
            </button>
 
        </div>
    )
}

```

**Code Explanation:**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Lines 12-15**: Here, we're destructuring several properties from the `useRichTextEditor` hook. These include `isImageOperationsEnabled`, `enableImageOperations`, `imageOperationsData`, and `fetchImageOperationsData`.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 46**: Here, in our 'RichTextEditor' component, we are passing 3 new props that are specific to cloud image upload:
   - Prop `cloudImageApiEndpoint`: We are passing the backend server's API endpoint which manages image operations.
   - Prop `isImageOperationsEnabled`: We are passing "isImageOperationsEnabled" which we have destructured from useRichTextEditor hook
   - Prop `fetchImageOperationsData`: We are passing the "fetchImageOperationsData" which we have destructured from useRichTextEditor hook 

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 72**: Notice the "Submit" button. When clicked, it triggers the `handleSubmit` function defined on line 19.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **handleSubmit Function**: This function calls `enableImageOperations`, which sends a request to the backend to initiate image-related operations.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 27**: We employ `useEffect` with a dependency of `imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink`. This `imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink` changes only when the image operations are complete, and blob images in the output are replaced with their cloud URLs.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Conditional useEffect Execution**: We use `useRef` to ensure that the `useEffect` logic is skipped during the component's initial render. This is why you see `notInitialRender.current` being checked and updated within the `useEffect`.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Inside useEffect**: You'll notice a comment indicating where to place your custom code. This is where you'd typically insert API calls to save the user's rich text editor content after image operations are complete.

#### Setting Up the Backend

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up an Express server and using Cloudinary for cloud storage. Keep in mind, you're not restricted to using Express or Cloudinary. You can choose any backend framework and cloud storage service that suits your needs.

The key requirement is to ensure that the API endpoint responsible for handling the rich text editor's images should return an array that includes both the `secure_url` and `public_id` for each uploaded image:


> Here is the full code for the backend server with `Express`, for uploading image, we are using `express-fileupload` package.
```js copy

// import built-in node modules 
import fs from 'fs'

// import packages
import express from 'express'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
import fileUpload from 'express-fileupload'
import { v2 as cloudinary } from 'cloudinary'


// express app
const app = express()

// dotenv
dotenv.config()

// port
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000

// cloudinary configuration
cloudinary.config({
    cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
    api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
    api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
})


// middleware to parse the request body
app.use(express.json())

// middleware to upload files
app.use(
    fileUpload({ useTempFiles: true })
)


// upload and delete images
app.post('/api/v1/rte/manage-image', async (req, res) => {


    try {

        // ðŸ«“ configuration object
        const configuration = {
            imagesToUploadFieldName: 'imagesToUpload',
            imagesToDeleteFieldName: 'imagesToDelete',
            cloudinaryFolderName: config_obj.env.cloudinary_folder_name
        }


        // ðŸ«“ getting the temporarily uploaded images 
        let temporarilyUploadedImages = []

        if (req.files?.hasOwnProperty(configuration.imagesToUploadFieldName)) {

            temporarilyUploadedImages = req.files[configuration.imagesToUploadFieldName]


            // if "temporarilyUploadedImages" is already not an array, make it an array
            if (!Array.isArray(temporarilyUploadedImages)) {
                temporarilyUploadedImages = [temporarilyUploadedImages]
            } 

        }


        // ðŸ«“ getting the ids of the images which we need to delete 
        let idsOfImagesToDelete = []


        if(req.body.hasOwnProperty(configuration.imagesToDeleteFieldName)) {
            
            idsOfImagesToDelete = req.body[configuration.imagesToDeleteFieldName]


            // if "idsOfImagesToDelete" is already not an array, make it an array
            if (!Array.isArray(idsOfImagesToDelete)) {

                idsOfImagesToDelete = [idsOfImagesToDelete]
            } 
        }


        // ðŸ«“ now, we will update the images

        // after uploading the images, we we will store their public_id and link in the following array. 
        let result = []

        // the following loop will upload the images to the cloudinary and push their info in the "result array"   
        if (temporarilyUploadedImages.length > 0) {

            for (let i = 0; i < temporarilyUploadedImages.length; i++) {
                /* To upload an image, cloudinary needs a temporary path of the image from the server. So, let's first get that */
                const image_temp_path = temporarilyUploadedImages[i].tempFilePath

                /*  uploading the image on cloudinary*/
                try {
                    const uploaded_image_on_cloudinary = await cloudinary.uploader.upload(

                        image_temp_path,

                        {
                            /* specifying the folder in which the image would get uploaded   */
                            folder: configuration.cloudinaryFolderName,

                            /* setting the name of the image */
                            public_id: temporarilyUploadedImages[i].name,

                            /* we don't want cloudinary to change the name automatically it order to try to make it unique*/
                            unique_filename: false,
                        }
                    )

                }
            }
        }


        // ðŸ«“ now, we will delete the images
        if (idsOfImagesToDelete.length > 0) {

            // iterating over the 'public_id_of_images'
            for (const public_id of idsOfImagesToDelete) {

                try {
                    await cloudinary.uploader.destroy(public_id)
                }
