### Used Technologies

&nbsp;

`Quill.js`

We are utilizing the popular JavaScript library Quill under the hood. However, you do not need to install Quill separately, as it is already integrated into and bundled with this library. 


&nbsp;


`Material Design`

For the UI, we are following Material Design.




&nbsp;


`Highlight.js`

To highlight the code written in the editor, we are using the popular hightlight.js library. But no need to install Highlight.js, itâ€™s already bundled with this library.





&nbsp;

### Avoided Technologies

&nbsp;



`quill-resize-image-module`

This library has a built-in option for resizing inserted images. We are not using [quill-resize-image-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize-module) or [quill-resize-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize) for resizing image in the editor. At first, we considered using these libraries but these libraries have some problems:

 - They use 'px' for resizing images. So, the resized image is not responsive. 

- Resizing doesn't work on the touch screen because these libraries only work with mouse event
