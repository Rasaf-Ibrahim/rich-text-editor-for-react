### Upload Image in Cloud
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>


If you have read about [toolbarOptions](/render-rich-text-editor#toolbaroptions), you may already know you have two choices for handling images. The first is embedding images as base64 strings directly in the editor. The second is uploading images to cloud storage and using the image URL in the editor.

If you've passed for the `image_base64` in the `toolbarOptions` prop, you're all setâ€”no further configuration is needed. However, if you've passed `image_cloud` because you prefer to store images in the cloud and use URLs in the editor, then this guide is for you.

#### How the Image Upload to Cloud Happens: A Quick Overview

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- As you have choosen `image_cloud`, so now everytime user inserts an image on the editor, it will get inserted as a `blob` image.

- Now, let's assume there's a "Submit" button that the user clicks after they've finished writing. At this point, all blob images in the output will be uploaded to your cloud storage. After a successful upload, each blob URL will be replaced with its corresponding cloud URL.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

> *Why Have We Decided to Upload Images All at Once Instead of One by One?*
>
> - When users are writing, they often insert multiple images just to try them out. If we upload images one by one as they're added, we risk uploading images that the user might eventually remove. Even if we track these removed images and delete them from cloud storage, this approach still consumes extra time and bandwidth unnecessarily.
> - Moreover, If the user upload couple of images individually and closes the browser or uninstalls the browser, we lose the ability to track the images that has already been uploaded.
> - Conversely, by waiting for a "Submit" action and only uploading the images that the user has finalized, we can optimize both time and bandwidth usage.





<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Prerequisite

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

You'll need a backend server to manage cloud uploads. You can use any programming language or framework of your choice for the backend server.

Below, we'll walk through setting up both the frontend and backend.



<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Setting Up the Frontend

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

Initially, we'll go through the code, followed by an in-depth explanation

```tsx showLineNumbers /isImageOperationsEnabled/ /enableImageOperations/ /imageOperationsData/  /fetchImageOperationsData/ /cloudImageApiEndpoint/ copy
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'
 
// import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook/
// ...
 
export default function Demo() {
 
    // Destructuring properties from useRichTextEditor
    const {
        output,
        fetchOutput, 
        isImageOperationsEnabled,  
        enableImageOperations,  
        imageOperationsData,  
        fetchImageOperationsData  
    } = useRichTextEditor()
 
    // handleSubmit function
    const handleSubmit = () => {
        enableImageOperations() 
    }
 
    //Using useRef for conditional useEffect execution
    const notInitialRender = useRef(false)
 
    // useEffect hook
    useEffect(() => {
 
        if (notInitialRender.current) {
            // Custom code placeholder
            // Put your code here. The code will only run when the dependency changes, not on the initial render of the component
        } 

        else {
            notInitialRender.current = true  
        }
 
    }, [imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink])  
 
    
    // JSX
    return (
 
        <div> 
 
            <RichTextEditor
            
                toolbarOptions={[
                    'image_cloud',
                    //...
                ]}
 
                customizeUI={{
                    // ...
                }}
 
                fetchOutput={fetchOutput}
 
                imageValidation={{
                    maximumFileSize: 1024,
                    acceptableFileFormats: ['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg']
                }}
 
                cloudImageApiEndpoint="https://your-server-domain.com/api/v1/rte/manage-image"  
 
                isImageOperationsEnabled={isImageOperationsEnabled}  
 
                fetchImageOperationsData={fetchImageOperationsData}  
            />
 
            {/* Submit button */}
            <button onClick={handleSubmit}>
                Submit
            </button>
 
        </div>
    )
}

```

**Code Explanation:**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Lines 12-15**: Here, we're destructuring several properties from the `useRichTextEditor` hook. These include `isImageOperationsEnabled`, `enableImageOperations`, `imageOperationsData`, and `fetchImageOperationsData`.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 46**: Here, in our 'RichTextEditor' component, we are passing 3 new props that are specific to cloud image upload:
   - Prop `cloudImageApiEndpoint`: We are passing the backend server's API endpoint which manages image operations.
   - Prop `isImageOperationsEnabled`: We are passing "isImageOperationsEnabled" which we have destructured from useRichTextEditor hook
   - Prop `fetchImageOperationsData`: We are passing the "fetchImageOperationsData" which we have destructured from useRichTextEditor hook 

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 72**: Notice the "Submit" button. When clicked, it triggers the `handleSubmit` function defined on line 19.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **handleSubmit Function**: This function calls `enableImageOperations`, which sends a request to the backend to initiate image-related operations.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Line 27**: We employ `useEffect` with a dependency of `imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink`. This `imageOperationsData.outputUpdatedWithImageLink` changes only when the image operations are complete, and blob images in the output are replaced with their cloud URLs.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Conditional useEffect Execution**: We use `useRef` to ensure that the `useEffect` logic is skipped during the component's initial render. This is why you see `notInitialRender.current` being checked and updated within the `useEffect`.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Inside useEffect**: You'll notice a comment indicating where to place your custom code. This is where you'd typically insert API calls to save the user's rich text editor content after image operations are complete.
