#### `customizeUI` Prop: An Example Before We Dive Deep

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

    
```ts showLineNumbers {5-6, 17-45} copy  
// import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook/
// ...


import hljs from 'highlight.js';
import 'highlight.js/styles/atom-one-dark.css'


export default function Demo() {

    // ...

    return (

        <RichTextEditor

            customizeUI={{
                backgroundColor: '#fcfcfc',

                primaryColor: '#20464b',

                iconColor: '#121212'

                stickyToolbarOnScroll: true,

                highlightJS: hljs,

                defaultVisibleToolbarOptions:{
                    phone: 5,
                    tablet:8,
                    laptop:15
                },

                typography: {
                    p:{
                        fontSize: '1rem',
                        fontFamily: "'Noto Sans', sans-serif",
                        fontWeight: 400,
                        lineHeight: 1.5,
                        letterSpacing: '0.001em',
                    },

                    //...
                }
            }}

            //...
        />

    )
}
```



In the example usage above, you've seen how the customizeUI prop can be leveraged to tailor the RichTextEditor's UI to your specific needs. In the following sections of this page, we'll dissect every single property available within customizeUI, so you can gain a full understanding of how to make the editor truly your own.


<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Background, Primary & Icon Color

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


```jsx copy  
customizeUI={{
    backgroundColor: '#fcfcfc', // required
    primaryColor: '#20464b' // required
    iconColor: '#121212' //optional
}}
```

Here's how these properties affect the UI:

- `backgroundColor`: Sets the background color for both the toolbar and editor. The text color adjusts automatically based on the chosen background color.
- `primaryColor`: Defines the color for buttons and specific text elements, enhancing the UI.
- `iconColor`: Specifies the color of icons in the toolbar.


<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Theming 

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

If you are using themes like dark and light modes in your application, you can adjust the editor's colors dynamically. Assuming you have a state like `isDarkMode` which becomes `true` when the application is in dark mode and `false` during light mode:

```jsx copy
customizeUI={{
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? '#000000' : '#fcfcfc',
    primaryColor: isDarkMode ? '#ffffff' : '#20464b',
    iconColor: isDarkMode ? '#f0f0f0' : '#121212'
}}
```




<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Typography

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

If you've included "header" in the `toolbarOptions` prop, the toolbar will display a "header" option. This enables users to select text styles like "Normal", "Heading 1", "Heading 2", "Heading 3", and others. 

By default, these styles have predefined appearances and it's optional to customize these styles. But if you want to ensure the editor's typography matches your application's design, you can provide  custom styles for these headers by using the `typography` property inside the `customizeUI` prop:

```jsx copy
customizeUI={{

    typography: {

        // Style for "Normal" text
        p:{
            fontSize: '1rem',
            fontFamily: "'Noto Sans', sans-serif",
            fontWeight: 400,
            lineHeight: 1.5,
            letterSpacing: '0.001em',
        },

        // Style for "Heading 5"
        h5:{
            fontSize: '0.9rem',
            fontFamily: "'Noto Sans', sans-serif",
            fontWeight: 500,
            lineHeight: 1.4,
            letterSpacing: '0.001em',
        }
    }
    
}}
```

In this example:
- The style for "Normal" text is represented by the `p` key.
- The style for "Heading 5" is represented by the `h5` key.

You're free to customize any heading level. For example:
- Use `h1` for "Heading 1"
- Use `h2` for "Heading 2"
... and so on.

Each heading key allows you to set properties such as "fontSize", "fontFamily", "fontWeight", "lineHeight", and "letterSpacing". You can choose to set all of these or only the ones you need.


<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Stick the Toolbar at the Top on Scroll

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


For a seamless user experience, it's essential that the toolbar remains easily accessible. If it disappears from view as users scroll, they might find it cumbersome to scroll back up every time they need to use a toolbar option.

To enhance usability, you can make the toolbar "sticky" at the top when users scroll past it. Achieve this by setting the `stickyToolbarOnScroll` property to `true` within the `customizeUI` prop:

```jsx copy
customizeUI={{
    stickyToolbarOnScroll: true
}}
```

This property is optional, and its default value is `false`, meaning the toolbar won't stick unless explicitly set.



<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Code Highlighting in the Editor

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

When you include "code" in the `toolbarOptions` prop, the toolbar will show a "Code Block" option, allowing users to input code within a designated block.

However, syntax highlighting for the code isn't enabled by default. To activate code highlighting, you'll need to integrate the `highlight.js` package. The good news is, it's a straightforward process without any complex configurations.

First, install the `highlight.js` package in your React project:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>

  <Tab>

   ```shell copy
       npm install highlight.js
   ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>

   ```shell copy
       yarn add highlight.js
   ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

Next, import the package and its desired style into your component, then pass it to the `customizeUI` prop:

 ```ts showLineNumbers {4-5, 14} /hljs/ copy  
    // import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook/
    // ...

    import hljs from 'highlight.js';
    import 'highlight.js/styles/atom-one-dark.css'

    export default function Demo() {

        // ...

        return (
            <RichTextEditor
                customizeUI={{
                    highlightJS: hljs,

                    //...
                }}
                //...
            />
        )
    }
```

In the example above, the `atom-one-dark.css` style is used for highlighting. However, `highlight.js` offers various styles, and you can choose any of them. Here are a few alternatives:

```jsx copy
import 'highlight.js/styles/default.css';
```

```jsx copy
import 'highlight.js/styles/github.css'
```

```jsx copy
import 'highlight.js/styles/github-dark-dimmed.css'
```

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

> **Note**: In designing the `rich-text-editor-for-react` package, we had the option to bundle it with `highlight.js`. This would have meant that you wouldn't need to install `highlight.js` separately. However, we understood that not every Developer using the `rich-text-editor-for-react` package would need the `Code Block` feature. Therefore, to maintain a streamlined package size, we chose not to include `highlight.js` by default.


<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### Set the Number of Default Visible Toolbar Options

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


If you've explored our [demo](https://rich-text-editor-for-react.rasaf-ibrahim.com), you might've noticed that not all toolbar options are visible right away. Instead, there's a `more` button. Clicking this reveals all the available toolbar options.

Why do we use this approach? The [demo](https://rich-text-editor-for-react.rasaf-ibrahim.com) has over 25 toolbar options. Displaying all these options, especially on smaller screens like mobiles, would consume a significant amount of space. Additionally, the on-screen keyboard on mobile devices occupies space.So, the `more/less` button helps keep things tidy and user-friendly.

By default, you'll see:
- 5 toolbar options on mobile screens
- 7 on tablet screens
- 7 on laptop screens



To customize these default settings, you can utilize the `defaultVisibleToolbarOptions` property within the `customizeUI` prop. This allows you to specify the number of toolbar options you wish to display for each device type:

```tsx copy
 customizeUI={{
                     
    defaultVisibleToolbarOptions:{
        phone: 5,
        tablet: 8,
        laptop: 15
    }

}}
```
