`quill-resize-image-module`

This library has a built-in option for resizing inserted images. We are not using [quill-resize-image-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize-module) or [quill-resize-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize) for resizing image in the editor. At first, we considered using these libraries but these libraries have some problems:

 - They use 'px' for resizing images. So, the resized image is not responsive. 

- Resizing doesn't work on the touch screen because these libraries only work with mouse event
