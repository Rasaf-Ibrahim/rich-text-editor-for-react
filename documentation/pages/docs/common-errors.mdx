### Common Errors & Solution
<HORIZONTAL_LINE_SPACER___COMPONENT/>



<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### `ReactTextEditor` cannot be used as a JSX component

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- If you are using Next.js with TypeScript, you may encounter this error during the build process.
- To resolve this error, you can use the `any` type for the "RichTextEditor" component:

```tsx showLineNumbers {1} /any/ copy  
 const RichTextEditor:any = dynamic(
    () => import('rich-text-editor-for-react'),
    {
        ssr: false,
        loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
    }
  )
```

- But using the `any` type for the "RichTextEditor" component means you won't receive proper typing assistance from your IDE.
- To get proper type assistance during development, you can use the `any` type just before building for production as this error won't occur in development mode.
