`quill-resize-image-module`


Our editor comes with a native feature for resizing images. It's worth noting that we don't rely on external libraries like [quill-resize-image-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize-module) or [quill-resize-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-image-resize) for this functionality. While we initially considered integrating these libraries, we identified a couple of limitations:

- They employ 'px' units for image resizing, which results in non-responsive images.
  
- Their resizing functionality is not compatible with touch screens, as they are designed to respond solely to mouse events.
