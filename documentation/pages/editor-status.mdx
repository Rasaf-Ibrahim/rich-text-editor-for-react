### Editor Status
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>

At times, you'll need to track the editor's current state. For instance, you might need to check if the editor is currently focused, or perhaps you want to enforce a word or character limit. To achieve these tasks, you'll need to access the editor's state.

To get the editor's state, destructure `editorStatus` and `fetchEditorStatus` from the `useRichTextEditor` hook.

Here's how to do it:

```tsx  showLineNumbers {6, 12} copy
// import RichTextEditor component & useRichTextEditor hook/
// ...

export default function Demo() {

  const { editorStatus, fetchEditorStatus } = useRichTextEditor();

  return (

    <RichTextEditor

      fetchEditorStatus={fetchEditorStatus}

      // ...
    />

    // ...
  )

}
```

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT />

> **Passing `fetchEditorStatus` to RichTextEditor Component**

The "RichTextEditor" component accepts a `fetchEditorStatus` prop. Simply pass the `fetchEditorStatus` function you've destructured from the "useRichTextEditor" hook to this prop.

> **Utilizing `editorStatus`**

With the `editorStatus` object, you can access a set of properties for tracking the current state of the editor:


- **hasFocus**: Use this property to determine if the editor is focused. For example, you can use `editorStatus.hasFocus` to conditionally trigger specific actions.

- **totalWords**: With this property, you get the total word count in the editor. So, you can use `editorStatus.totalWords` to enforce a word limit by showing an error message, or simply display the current word count to the user.

- **totalCharacters**: This property gives you the total character count. The use case is similar to `totalWords`. You can use `editorStatus.totalCharacters` to either enforce a character limit and show an error message if exceeded, or display the current character count to the user.

- **totalCharactersExcludingSpacing**: This property counts characters without including spaces. The use case is similar to `totalWords`. You can use `editorStatus.totalCharacters` to set a character limit without spaces, or just show the user the character count, excluding spaces.
